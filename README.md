# My Data Science Projects

This is my collection of data science projects.
Each project has its own folder. 
More information about these projects is listed below.

### cryptocurrencies

Used in my blog post ["An Analysis of Cryptocurrency Trends"](http://johncrattz.com/an-analysis-of-cryptocurrency-trends/).

This was my first project. 
This project analyzed cryptocurrency trends and attempted
to predict future values of the currencies based on their 
previous values, but the predictions from the machine learning 
model did not closely follow the real values for dates after 
the end of the data. Predicting future values for financial assets 
based purely on their previous values generally will not
create very accurate models, especially in a highly volatile
market like the cryptocurrency market in the latter half of 2017 
through the beginning of 2018. Still, it showcases my understanding 
of various Python data analysis and data visualization libraries, 
such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly 
(along with cufflinks).

Check out the IPython notebook (**Cryptocurrencies_v2.ipynb**) 
in that directory for a nice interactive plot of the value 
histories ("value trends" in the notebook) for the various 
cryptocurrencies.
